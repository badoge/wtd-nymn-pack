# What the Dub?! - nymn pack
This is a pack of clips taken from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAndChill/comments/mtacw3/lets_make_new_what_the_dub_vids_peepopog) to be used in the game called [What the Dub?!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1495860/What_The_Dub/)

I fixed the subtitles and adjusted the timings of the clips from that thread and compiled them in this repo :)
